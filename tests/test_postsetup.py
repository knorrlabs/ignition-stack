"""Phase 7 acceptance tests for the ``POST-SETUP.md`` generator.

The matrix contract has two halves, and both are asserted here:

1. A stack with >=1 manual-secret connection gets one section per manual step,
   and each section carries the three things a user needs to finish it by hand:
   the deep-link URL to open, the in-UI screen path to navigate to, and the
   exact ``.env`` variable name to copy.
2. A fully-seedable stack (basic + Postgres) states, unambiguously, that
   no manual steps are required.
