"""Progress breadcrumb for the wizard step machine (issue #60).

Tests for:
- ``_breadcrumb``: pure string-builder, independent of the prompter/walk.
- ``applicable_steps``: count correctness per architecture.
- Recount after back + architecture change (hub-and-spoke adds "spokes").
- Elision of the middle trail when the line is too long.
