"""switch-arch carries the service registry across a reshape.

These tests pin the Phase-6 carry semantics:

- IIoT intent (broker + Transmission/Engine roles) is recovered into
  ``ArchOptions`` and re-applied by ``apply_iiot`` in the new topology, so the
  pipeline re-maps onto the new roles (spokes' Transmission -> frontends';
  hub's Engine -> backend's).
- Richer registry shapes ``ArchOptions`` can't express - custom instance ids,
  per-instance overrides, partial / role-specific attachments, a second database
  - are re-grafted onto the rebuilt config by role, with attachments the new
  topology can't host dropped and a printed advisory.
- Re-grafting respects the new topology's invariants (Edge never_on_edge,
  one database per gateway): a violating attachment is dropped, not raised.

The driver is the real ``switch-arch`` CLI command via ``CliRunner`` so the
advisory output is captured exactly as a user would see it.
