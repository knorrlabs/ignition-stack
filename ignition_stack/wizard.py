"""Interactive wizard that walks the architecture decision tree.

The wizard's *core* (``walk()``) is a pure function over a small
:class:`Prompter` protocol. Real CLI invocations pass a
:class:`QuestionaryPrompter` that delegates to ``questionary``; tests pass
a :class:`ScriptedPrompter` with a pre-recorded sequence of answers and
assert on the resulting :class:`ProjectConfig`. Wizard logic stays
testable without a TTY this way.

The UX shape borrows from Create T3 App: select -> defaults -> summary ->
generate. Each step is one Questionary prompt; the summary screen
recaps the resolved choices and gates the write.

The wizard is **architecture-first**: the very first prompt is the architecture
select (Basic / Scale Out / Hub and Spoke, mirroring Ignition's documented
system architectures). There is no preliminary "how do you want to build?"
gate; the per-gateway composer is reached one way only, through the summary's
*tweak* action.

Step order:

1. **Architecture** - which of the system architectures the user wants.
2. **Architecture-specific count** - spoke count for hub-and-spoke, frontend
   count for scale-out (skipped for single-gateway architectures).
3. **Database** - SQL flavor for the stack, or "none".
4. **Edition per role** - which role (if any) runs Edge. The default is
   architecture-driven: basic/scale-out propose "none", hub-and-spoke "spoke".
5. **Network split** - for the multi-gateway architectures (scale-out +
   hub-and-spoke), whether to split frontend/backend onto separate
   networks. Defaults on for scale-out, off for hub-and-spoke.
6. **Redundancy** - for architectures with a single workhorse role (basic
   gateway, scale-out backend, hub-and-spoke hub), whether to add a backup
   node and form a master/backup pair. Defaults off.
7. **IIoT** - whether to add an IIoT (MQTT/Sparkplug) pipeline. Default no;
   on "yes" a broker select defaults to chariot. Wires Cirrus Transmission to
   edge-side roles and Engine to central roles via ``apply_iiot``.
8. **Modules** - opt-in selection of built-in IA modules. A curated default
   set (Perspective, OPC-UA, SQL Bridge, the historian pair, Alarm
   Notification, Reporting) plus the JDBC driver matching the chosen database
   are pre-checked; the un-selected remainder becomes ``disable_builtins``,
   which the engine inverts into the GATEWAY_MODULES_ENABLED whitelist. Gated
   behind a "Customize?" confirm; declining accepts the lean default.
9. **Exposure** - host ports (default) or a reverse proxy. Choosing the proxy
   detects an existing ``proxy`` Docker network and offers to join it, else asks
   for the network name or scaffolds ``ia-eknorr/traefik-reverse-proxy``.
10. **Summary** - a three-way select: *generate* (write the project),
    *tweak* (hand the built+resolved config to the composer pre-filled),
    or *cancel* (abort).

Per-gateway env-var overrides (``memory_mb`` etc.) are deferred to a future
phase; the gateway model already accepts them, so adding a wizard step on top
is a non-breaking follow-up.

Back-navigation (issue #59)
---------------------------

The flow is a **step machine, steps as data**: :data:`WIZARD_STEPS` is an
ordered list of :class:`Step` objects, each with a ``name``, a human ``label``
(for the issue #60 breadcrumb), an ``applies(answers)`` predicate, and an
``ask(prompter, answers, allow_back)`` callable that prompts and returns the
step's answer (or the :data:`BACK` sentinel). Walking advances through the
applicable steps recording answers; the summary is reached when the cursor runs
off the end of the list. The list is introspectable - given an ``answers`` dict
you can recover the names, the applicable subset, and the current position -
which is what the follow-up breadcrumb will render.

*Going back re-asks from that step forward.* Backing pops to the previous
**applicable** step (skipped steps are jumped in both directions); each
subsequent step is then re-asked, with the previously stored answer replayed as
its default (select default = prior choice, confirm default = prior bool,
integer default = prior value). This "replay forward, re-asking each" rule is
deliberately the simpler of the two candidates: every later answer is
re-confirmed rather than silently kept, so **invalidation is automatic** - an
answer that is no longer a legal choice for the changed earlier answer (e.g. the
edge-role after switching architecture from hub-and-spoke to basic) is dropped
because its step re-asks and its stale value, not being in the new choice set,
falls back to the step's canonical default. Newly-applicable steps (a spoke
count that only exists for hub-and-spoke) are asked; newly-inapplicable ones are
skipped and their stored answers ignored at build time.

*Back affordance.* Back is offered on **select** prompts (a dim "Back" choice
appended last, mapped to :data:`BACK`) and on **confirm** prompts (rendered as a
Yes/No/Back select when ``allow_back`` is set). **Integer** and **text** prompts
have no Back affordance in v1: the only integer steps are the spoke/frontend
counts, which sit directly after the architecture select, and text prompts
appear only as reverse-proxy sub-questions. You can still step *into* those
steps from a later select (their prior value replays as the default); you just
cannot *initiate* a back from them. The architecture select is the first prompt,
so it offers no Back affordance - there is nowhere earlier to go. The summary
select carries a Back option, returning the user to the last question instead of
forcing a cancel. The :data:`BACK` sentinel keeps the ``Prompter`` protocol
test-mockable: ``ScriptedPrompter`` drives back-navigation by yielding ``BACK``
in its answer script, exactly where ``QuestionaryPrompter`` would map the Back
choice.
