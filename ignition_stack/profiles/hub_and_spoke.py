"""Hub-and-spoke profile: 1 central hub + N spoke gateways.

Edge gateways typically run as the spokes (lightweight, deployed close to
the data); the hub aggregates them. Per the design's tiered-advisory
decision, the spoke count drives an advisory: green ≤4, yellow 5-8, red
≥9 (refuses without ``--force``). The advisory itself lives in
:mod:`ignition_stack.profiles.advisory`; this profile wires it into the
build path so a bare ``build()`` raises ``ProfileError`` on the red tier
unless ``options.force`` is set.

Reverse-proxy / database / services flow through the standard
``ProfileOptions`` contract; a hub-and-spoke stack is just a multi-gateway
arrangement with a specific role layout and the advisory gate.
