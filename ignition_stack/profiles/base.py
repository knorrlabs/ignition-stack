"""Profile contract + options + registry.

A *profile* is the small piece of code that turns the user's high-level
intent ("scaleout", "hub-and-spoke with 3 spokes", "mcp-n8n demo") into a
fully-formed :class:`ProjectConfig`. The compose engine and the dependency
resolver are profile-agnostic; profiles only shape the inputs they take.

Two-stage pipeline:

1. Either the CLI flags or the wizard answers populate a
   :class:`ProfileOptions` and pick a profile slug.
2. ``build_profile(slug, name, options)`` looks up the profile and calls
   its ``build()`` method, returning a ``ProjectConfig`` that
   ``services.resolver.resolve()`` then expands the usual implicit deps on.

Each profile is a small dataclass with three pieces:

- ``slug`` - the wizard/flag value users type.
- ``summary`` - one-line description for the wizard menu + docs.
- ``build`` - pure function ``(name, options) -> ProjectConfig``.

Keeping ``build`` pure (no I/O, no prompts) is what lets the wizard layer
and the CLI flag layer share the same code path and stay testable.
