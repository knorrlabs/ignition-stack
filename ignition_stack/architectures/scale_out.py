"""Scale-out architecture: N frontend gateways + 1 backend, networked together.

This mirrors Ignition's documented Scale Out architecture. Two roles:
``frontend`` (user-facing UI / OPC-UA aggregation) and ``backend`` (the
database-connected workhorse). Every gateway runs the standard edition by
default - the all-standard shape is the common case; opt a role into Edge with
``edge_role``. With one frontend the gateway is named ``frontend``; with N>1
they are ``frontend-1``..``frontend-N``. Ports step up from 9088, the backend
taking the next free port. Every gateway joins the frontend AND backend
networks so a frontend can reach the DB the backend owns. The network split is
on by default - that's the whole point of the scale-out demo - but
``options.network_split`` can override it.

The gateway-network link auto-forms with no UI approval: each frontend gets
``gan_outgoing=["backend"]``, which the compose engine renders as a plain
(non-SSL, port 8088) outgoing Gateway Network connection, and every participant
runs an ``Unrestricted`` incoming policy so the link is accepted on sight - the
same proven pattern the redundancy link rides. POST-SETUP carries a *verify*
step (not a manual procedure). Today the ``services`` list is empty by default;
users add brokers/IDPs on top.
