"""Project tree writer.

The writer composes a generated project at ``<output>/<name>/`` by:

1. Copying the static asset tree (``scripts/``, ``services/<dir>/``)
   from the package's template payload, parametrised per-gateway when
   the project has more than one.
2. Rendering ``docker-compose.yaml`` through
   :func:`ignition_stack.compose.engine.render_compose`, which preserves
   YAML anchors via ruamel.yaml.
3. Rendering ``.env`` from the resolved :class:`ProjectConfig`,
   including per-gateway HTTP port entries when the project is
   multi-gateway.

Every file is written in binary with explicit ``\\n`` newlines so the
output is byte-identical on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
``docker-bootstrap.sh`` in particular must be LF-only or bash inside
the container chokes on CR bytes.
