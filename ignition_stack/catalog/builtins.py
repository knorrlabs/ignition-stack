"""Load and query the built-in IA module catalog (``builtin_modules.yaml``).

The third-party catalog (``modules.yaml`` + ``catalog/schema.py``) covers
modules the CLI *adds*. This module covers the modules that *already ship*
inside the gateway image, which the engine needs in order to translate a
gateway's ``disable_builtins`` slugs into a ``GATEWAY_MODULES_ENABLED``
whitelist.

The whitelist is strict: anything not listed is quarantined at boot. So
"disable Vision" is expressed as "enable every built-in except Vision",
which requires the *complete* built-in set - hence a pinned data file plus a
smoke guard test that re-derives it from the live image.
