"""Matrix-driven ``POST-SETUP.md`` generator.

``ignition-stack`` pre-seeds every connection the Phase-1 seedability matrix
marks file-seedable (db-connection, the internal-secret-provider that holds
its password, OPC-UA endpoints, ...). The connections it *cannot* fully seed -
a secret generated at runtime, a module that isn't publicly downloadable, a
gateway-network handshake approved in the UI - are deferred to ``POST-SETUP.md``
and finished by hand once the stack is up.

This module turns the deferred set into that document. It is purely a function
of the resolved :class:`~ignition_stack.config.schema.ProjectConfig`:

1. Each catalog service's manifest declares its deferred connections in
   ``post_setup`` (a list of ``connection``/``reason`` pairs). The database and
   every selected service contribute theirs.
2. Stack-level flags add steps the matrix flags as not-fully-seedable:
   any gateway with ``gan_outgoing`` (the gateway-network link is UI-approved),
   ``mcp_dropin`` (the EA-gated MCP module), and a set ``reverse_proxy`` (the
   Traefik scaffold).

Each step renders through a per-connection Jinja2 snippet at
``templates/post-setup/<connection>.md.j2`` (falling back to ``_default.md.j2``)
so adding a new fallback connection is a manifest entry + a snippet, with no
change here. Every snippet gives the reader the three things the validation
contract requires: the **deep-link URL** to open, the **in-UI screen path** to
navigate to, and the exact **``.env`` variable name** to copy.
