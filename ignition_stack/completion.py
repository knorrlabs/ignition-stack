"""Shell-completion callbacks for dynamic CLI values.

Typer re-invokes the program on every ``<TAB>``, so these callbacks must be
cheap and must never raise - an exception here would surface as noise on the
user's shell line. They read only the in-memory architecture registry and the
local bundled ``modules.yaml``; they never touch the network.

Each callback takes the partial value the user has typed and returns the
matching candidates. Returning ``(value, help)`` tuples gives the richer
two-column completion menu that zsh and fish render.
